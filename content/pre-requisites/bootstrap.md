Bootstrap a Hugo site to hold the documentation of our mini-training.  

```raw
$ hugo new site hugo-workshop
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/nicolas/git/hugo-workshop.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/, or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
